# ghw-hello-world

**This program, written in C, prints "hello, world!"**
Through this program, I pay tribute to the famous pair of words that jump-started my coding journey and have stuck with me ever since.

What's next for GHW: Hello World?
- Hello World is going worldwide! Hola, Mundo! (Spanish). Selam, Alem (Amharic). And many more languages to come.
